                            After we have tagged people and populated our database with photos of known people, we can recognize a personâ€™s identity through two main steps:
                        </h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>
                                    Generating an encoding for each <i>known</i> person in the database using their faceprints.
                                </strong>
                                <p>
                                    Every face could be mapped out to a unique sequence of numbers known as a faceprint, and multiple algorithms are used to analyze the face features to generate its faceprint. The library we use <i>face-recognition 1.3.0</i> is built with deep learning whose model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the <a href="http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/" target="_blank">Labeled Faces in the Wild</a> benchmark.
                    We can feed the encoding of a person of one or more faceprints. The more faceprints for a person, the more accurate the model becomes especially with the cases of looking-like faces, and definitely, this is at the cost of more time encoding generation and comparisons. 
                                </p>
                                <img className="responsive-image2" src={B1}/>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>
                                    Recognize an <i>unknown</i> face in a photo.
                                </strong>
                                <p>
                                    This step is done by generating an encoding for this unknown face then comparing it to the encodings of different people in our database. Once we find a match between the encodings, this person is recognized. That is, to recognize a face and match it to a known person, we must have the person in our known database. If the face belongs to a person who is not in our database, then there is no way we can recognize them.
                                </p>

                            <p className='mt-5 font-weight-bold'>Further development will include a machine learning model to work as a classifier 
                            as another approach to recognize faces once we have a large dataset, 
                            then we will compare both approaches to use the one with higher efficiency. We will Test the model accuracy and try to maximize
                            the model's accuracy
